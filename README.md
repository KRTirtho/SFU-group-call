# SFU Group Call
A video conference web-app that is super fast & efficient

It uses **mediasoup** under the hood to provide fastest video conference experience. It has capability to broadcast for up to 50 participants simultaneously where traditional video-conferences are limited to 25-30 participants

Mediasoup is a SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) WebRTC server/client that is way faster & efficient than MCU (Multipoint Conferencing Unit)/Mesh WebRTC servers

If properly implemented & enough resources provided (4 core CPU & 8GB RAM recommended) it can handle 500 producer/consumer connection simultaneously

But it has a drawback of using huge amounts of ports. Minimum port usage is around 100

By using **mediasoup** for this application, this can be easily said that **SFU-group-call** is yet the fastest & smoothest video conferencing application demo along with other application project created with mediasoup
